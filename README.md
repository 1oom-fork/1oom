1oom
====

1oom aims to accurately reproduce the original DOS version of Master of Orion (1993) in a form that can be run on modern computers.
1oom is Free Software (GPLv2), see [COPYING](COPYING).

Versions [1.0 and earlier](https://gitlab.com/KilgoreTroutMaskReplicant/1oom) contain hundreds of obvious inconsistencies with the original logic and even fatal errors in the code.
WARNING: 1.0 is not the vanilla version. The vanilla version has moved to gitverse.ru

Versions 2019-2021 (Tapani's fork) breaks numerous vanilla mechanics, including the interface. It's one of the most unreliable versions of the game.

Versions 1.7.5, 1.8.1-1.11.8 ([MyName's fork](https://github.com/1oom-fork/1oom)) cleans up Tapani's fork, fixes most of the most notable bugs, but not all, and also changes some interface elements.

The vanilla version (2026 and later) is published on [Gitverse mirror](https://gitverse.ru/1oom-fork/1oom) and aims to accurately reproduce the original artwork created in 1993.

An analysis of unofficial patches for the original game shows the need for a more responsible approach.
I'm working on creating a separate patch 1.3a for the original MOO1 game based on 1oom vanilla.
This patch is inextricably linked to 1oom vanilla and will be published together with it on gitverse.

1 Installation
===============

1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files.
Please note that older saved games may not work in newer versions of 1oom.

1.1 Windows, MSDOS
------------------

Simply extract the desired release to your MOO1 directory.
See [usage_common](doc/usage_common.txt) if you prefer to use a separate directory.

1.2 Unix (Linux)
----------------

1oom requires the following libraries:

- SDL (libsdl1.2 or libsdl2):
http://www.libsdl.org
- SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2 or libsdl2-mixer):
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

Also recommended:

- libsamplerate:
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsamplerate/

Check your distribution's package manager or the library
website on how to install them.

1.3 Android (DOSBox)
--------------------

To play on Android you will need the 1oom executable for MSDOS,
DOSBox application for Android and DPMI extension, for example
CWSDPMI. You can build the 1oom executable for MSDOS using i586
DJGPP and Allegro4.


2 Configuration
===============

See [usage_common](doc/usage_common.txt).


3 Development
=============

See [COMPILING](COMPILING) and [HACKING](HACKING) for more information.

1oom consists of a few executables:

- [1oom_classic_*](doc/usage_classic.txt)    (the 1993 UI)
- [1oom_cmdline](doc/usage_cmdline.txt)      (proof of concept textual UI)
- [1oom_lbxview_*](doc/usage_lbxview.txt)    (for viewing LBX files)
- [1oom_lbxedit](doc/usage_lbxedit.txt)      (for editing LBX files)

- 1oom_*_alleg4     (using Allegro 4.x)

See [usage_common](doc/usage_common.txt) for common documentation.

Some ports have shorter filenames due to filesystem limitations.

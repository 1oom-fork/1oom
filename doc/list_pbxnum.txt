This is an incomplete list of PBX number replacements.

(name : range, default)

bt_turn_max : 1..65535, 50
  - The number of battle turns before a forced retreat.

weapon_list_max : 0..64, 30
  - Max. number of weapons shown in the ship design weapon list.

monster_rest_att : 0..1, 0
  - Allow attacking resting space monsters.
    In MOO1 it is impossible to attack a space crystal or amoeba after the
    turn it has reached a planet.

combat_trans_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Make Combat Transporters work as intended.
    In MOO1 Combat Transporters only work if the planet owner has Sub-Space
    Interdictor, and using 25% roll followed by 50% roll if the first one
    failed. Enabling the fix makes it behave as OSG describes; chance is 50%/25%
    depending on Interdictor.

stargate_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix Star Gate fleet redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 a fleet sent via Star Gate can be redirected to any other planet
    and the flight will take only 1 turn regardless of destination. The other
    way was also bugged; redirecting a fleet to a valid Star Gate use situation
    did not end up in the fleet using the Star Gates.

trans_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix transport redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 transports can be redirected (given Hyperspace Communications) to
    unexplored. reserve-fuel-needing and no-colony-for destinations.

retreat_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix retreating fleet redirection back to battle bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 fleets retreating from battle can be redirected to fight again the
    next turn. This fix disables redirecting back to the planet the fleet just
    retreated from unless Hyperspace Communications is available.

event_roll : 0..2147483647, 512

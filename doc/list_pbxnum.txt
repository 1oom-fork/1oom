This is an incomplete list of PBX number replacements.

(name : range, default)

bt_turn_max : 1..65535, 50
  - The number of battle turns before a forced retreat.

weapon_list_max : 0..64, 30
  - Max. number of weapons shown in the ship design weapon list.

news_orion : 0..1, 0
  - Show news when Orion is first colonized.
    MOO1 has a news item for conquering Orion but never shows it.

aud_ask_break_nap : 0..1, 0
  - Include Non-Aggression Pact in Break Alliance With Another Race.
    The OSG claims that the audience dialog option is enabled if a NAP exists
    between any of the opponents. This is a filthy lie.

aud_bounty_give : 0..1, 0
  - Give promised bounty.
    The AI sometimes promises to give rewards for attacking an another player.
    In MOO1 the AI says something along the lines of "thnx, take this FOO tech"
    but never actually gives anything.

monster_rest_att : 0..1, 0
  - Allow attacking resting space monsters.
    In MOO1 it is impossible to attack a space crystal or amoeba after the
    turn it has reached a planet.

combat_trans_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Make Combat Transporters work as intended.
    In MOO1 Combat Transporters only work if the planet owner has Sub-Space
    Interdictor, and using 25% roll followed by 50% roll if the first one
    failed. Enabling the fix makes it behave as OSG describes; chance is 50%/25%
    depending on Interdictor.

stargate_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix Star Gate fleet redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 a fleet sent via Star Gate can be redirected to any other planet
    and the flight will take only 1 turn regardless of destination. The other
    way was also bugged; redirecting a fleet to a valid Star Gate use situation
    did not end up in the fleet using the Star Gates.

trans_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix transport redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 transports can be redirected (given Hyperspace Communications) to
    unexplored. reserve-fuel-needing and no-colony-for destinations.

retreat_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix retreating fleet redirection back to battle bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 fleets retreating from battle can be redirected to fight again the
    next turn. This fix disables redirecting back to the planet the fleet just
    retreated from unless Hyperspace Communications is available.

waste_adjust_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix waste elimination slider autoadjustment.
    In MOO1 the sum of sliders can exceed 100 due to weird math in the waste
    elimination slider adjustment code.

eco_slider_slack : 0..255, 7
  - Eco slider automatic adjustment slack.
    Reducing the value to 0 eliminates extraneous eco spending after population
    maximum has been reached.

event_roll : 0..2147483647, 512
  - Special event probability. Bigger number means events are less likely.
    Zero means events are disabled.

council_years : 0..32767, 25
  - Number of years between Galactic Council meetings.
    Zero means the Council never gathers.

crystal_* : ?, ?
amoeba_* : ?, ?
guardian_* : ?, ?
  - The index of these space monster tables is the difficulty level.

ngt_*_* : 0..255, ?
  - New game research list limitations for each field and race.
    Table index corresponds to tech level, for example ngt_we_meklar item 32
    controls Gauss Autocannon research availability for Meklars.
    The value 1 means the tech is never added, f.ex Silicoids & colony tech.
    The value 2 means the tech is always added. (Unused by default.)
    The bits 2..7 (values 4, 8, ...) are used for groups of essential techs;
    the research list must contain at least one of the techs with a given
    bit set. (Bit 2 / value 4 is the only one used by default.)

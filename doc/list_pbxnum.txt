This is an incomplete list of PBX number replacements.

(name : range, default)

bt_turn_max : 1..65535, 50
  - The number of battle turns before a forced retreat.

bt_wait_no_reload : 0..1, 0
  - Do not reload ship specials on Wait.
    MOO1 reloads ship specials when Wait is pressed and the ship's turn resumes.
    This means it is possible to fire the Pulsars, Black Hole Generator etc an
    unlimited number of times. Automated repair also kicks in on every resume
    from wait.

bt_precap_tohit : 0..1, 0
  - Add To Hit bonus before capping defense to 95%.
    MOO1 adds To Hit bonuses after capping defense. This results in high defense
    being less effective against high tech missiles.

bt_no_tohit_acc : 0..1, 0
  - Do not accumulate To Hit bonuses.
    MOO1 accumulates weapon To Hit bonuses while firing the four weapons slots.
    This results in Hyper-X or better missiles or Megabolt Cannon in slots 1..3
    affecting the accuracy of a beam weapon in slot 4.

weapon_list_max : 0..64, 30
  - Max. number of weapons shown in the ship design weapon list.

news_orion : 0..1, 0
  - Show news when Orion is first colonized.
    MOO1 has a news item for conquering Orion but never shows it.

monster_rest_att : 0..1, 0
  - Allow attacking resting space monsters.
    In MOO1 it is impossible to attack a space crystal or amoeba after the
    turn it has reached a planet.

orbital_weap_any : 0..1, 0
  - Allow orbital bombardment with any weapon type.
    In MOO1 neither Death Ray, Crystal Ray nor Amoeba Stream can be used for
    orbital bombardment. The last two are only available via save game editing,
    but the omission of Death Ray is puzzling.

orbital_weap_4 : 0..1, 0
  - Allow orbital bombardment with weapon in slot 4.
    In MOO1 the weapon in slot 4 is not used in orbital bombardment.

combat_trans_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Make Combat Transporters work as intended.
    In MOO1 Combat Transporters only work if the planet owner has Sub-Space
    Interdictor, and using 25% roll followed by 50% roll if the first one
    failed. Enabling the fix makes it behave as OSG describes; chance is 50%/25%
    depending on Interdictor.

stargate_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix Star Gate fleet redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 a fleet sent via Star Gate can be redirected to any other planet
    and the flight will take only 1 turn regardless of destination. The other
    way was also bugged; redirecting a fleet to a valid Star Gate use situation
    did not end up in the fleet using the Star Gates.

trans_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix transport redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 transports can be redirected (given Hyperspace Communications) to
    unexplored. reserve-fuel-needing and no-colony-for destinations.

event_roll : 0..2147483647, 512
  - Special event probability. Bigger number means events are less likely.
    Zero means events are disabled.

crystal_* : ?, ?
amoeba_* : ?, ?
guardian_* : ?, ?
  - The index of these space monster tables is the difficulty level.

This is an incomplete list of PBX number replacements.
Run with -dumpnum for the full list without explanations.

(name : range, default)

deterministic : 0..1, 1
  - Game is deterministic. Given the same input, the outcome
    remains the same. Reloading a save and clicking Next turn will not get rid
    of a nasty event. Setting this number to 0 makes sitting idle churn the
    random number generator for producing different results.

bt_turn_max : 1..65535, 50
  - The number of battle turns before a forced retreat.

bt_wait_no_reload : 0..1, 0
  - Do not reload ship specials on Wait.
    MOO1 reloads ship specials when Wait is pressed and the ship's turn resumes.
    This means it is possible to fire the Pulsars, Black Hole Generator etc an
    unlimited number of times. Automated repair also kicks in on every resume
    from wait.

bt_precap_tohit : 0..1, 0
  - Add To Hit bonus before capping defense to 95%.
    MOO1 adds To Hit bonuses after capping defense. This results in high defense
    being less effective against high tech missiles.

bt_no_tohit_acc : 0..1, 0
  - Do not accumulate To Hit bonuses.
    MOO1 accumulates weapon To Hit bonuses while firing the four weapons slots.
    This results in Hyper-X or better missiles or Megabolt Cannon in slots 1..3
    affecting the accuracy of a beam weapon in slot 4.

bt_oracle_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix the Oracle Interface.
    In MOO1 the Oracle Interface does nothing to the target's shields. The AI
    does take the target's (!) Oracle shield into account in damage esimates,
    including those related to missiles.

weapon_list_max : 0..64, 30
  - Max. number of weapons shown in the ship design weapon list.

news_orion : 0..1, 0
  - Show news when Orion is first colonized.
    MOO1 has a news item for conquering Orion but never shows it.

aud_ask_break_nap : 0..1, 0
  - Include Non-Aggression Pact in Break Alliance With Another Race.
    The OSG claims that the audience dialog option is enabled if a NAP exists
    between any of the opponents. This is a filthy lie.

aud_bounty_give : 0..1, 0
  - Give promised bounty.
    The AI sometimes promises to give rewards for attacking an another player.
    In MOO1 the AI says something along the lines of "thnx, take this FOO tech"
    but never actually gives anything.

monster_rest_att : 0..1, 0
  - Allow attacking resting space monsters.
    In MOO1 it is impossible to attack a space crystal or amoeba after the
    turn it has reached a planet.

combat_trans_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Make Combat Transporters work as intended.
    In MOO1 Combat Transporters only work if the planet owner has Sub-Space
    Interdictor, and using 25% roll followed by 50% roll if the first one
    failed. Enabling the fix makes it behave as OSG describes; chance is 50%/25%
    depending on Interdictor.

stargate_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix Star Gate fleet redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 a fleet sent via Star Gate can be redirected to any other planet
    and the flight will take only 1 turn regardless of destination. The other
    way was also bugged; redirecting a fleet to a valid Star Gate use situation
    did not end up in the fleet using the Star Gates.

trans_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix transport redirection bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 transports can be redirected (given Hyperspace Communications) to
    unexplored. reserve-fuel-needing and no-colony-for destinations.

retreat_redir_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix retreating fleet redirection back to battle bug/cheat.
    In MOO1 fleets retreating from battle can be redirected to fight again the
    next turn. This fix disables redirecting back to the planet the fleet just
    retreated from unless Hyperspace Communications is available.

first_tech_rp_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix RP stagnation before starting first tech project.
    Investing 1 RP to start the first project in a field is not enough due to
    the 10% stagnation rounding it down to 0.

waste_calc_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix waste calculation.
    MOO1 adds waste twice: first using a perfectly sensible formula and then
    a baffling one. The waste elimination cost is calculated in between.
    The second amount added is often negative due to the waste amount not
    being limited. This is why Silicoid planets end up with 0 waste. Other
    races only see the effect when setting the Eco slider below Clean.

waste_adjust_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix waste elimination slider autoadjustment.
    In MOO1 the sum of sliders can exceed 100 due to weird math in the waste
    elimination slider adjustment code.

eco_slider_slack : 0..255, 7
  - Eco slider automatic adjustment slack.
    Reducing the value to 0 eliminates extraneous eco spending after population
    maximum has been reached.

reset_tform_to_max : 0..1, 1
  - Reset terraforming to the player's maximum when finishing soil enrichment.
    If this value is 1 (the default), when the soil enrichment project is
    completed on a planet that has been terraformed to a higher level than
    the player has available, the terraforming is reset to the players
    maximum. If the value is 0, the alien terraforming is kept.

soil_rounding_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix incorrect rounding up with soil enrichment
    In older versions of 1oom and probably in MOO1 instead of rounding up to
    the next multiple of 5, the game adds an additional +5 unless the base size
    is in the range 50-59 or 100-109.

leaving_trans_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Population scheduled for transport no longer contributes to production.

hidden_child_labor_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Do not update production for SHIP, DEF and IND spending after ECO spending
    and pop growth. TECH spending is not affected and uses pre-growth values.
    A value of 1 means the same production for all sliders.

extended_reloc_range : 0..1, 0
  - Allow new fleets to relocate to any planet within range.
    MOO1 allows you to assign only controlled planets as reloc points.

colonized_factories_fix : 0..1, 0
  - Fix robotic controls factor for colonized factories
    There are scenarios that after destroying colony, the planet factories
    survive and new colony created by another player didn't reset robotic
    control factor of this colony. This fix resets the factor to 2 if no
    factories or to 1 if there are factories on the planet. This also sets
    bc_to_refit to 0.

cond_switch_to_ind_fix: 0..1, 0
  - Always switch production from eco to building factories rather than
    technology, regardless of current population.

doom_stack_fix : 0..1, 1
  - Fix negative/32000 ship doom stack bug.
    In MOO1 overflows in AI-AI battles can result in 32000 ship doom stacks.
    This bug is fixed by default but can be disabled for those who actually
    prefer the added challenge.

tech_costmuld : 0..255, ?
  - Research discovery base cost difficulty multiplier for human players.

tech_costmula : 0..255, ?
  - Research discovery base cost difficulty multiplier for AI players.

tcostm_* : 0..255, ?
  - Research discovery base cost racial modifier.

event_roll : 0..2147483647, 512
  - Special event probability. Bigger number means events are less likely.
    Zero means events are disabled.

accident_chk_factories : 0..1, 0
  - Only apply the industrial accident events to colonies with some industry.
    If this is set to 1, the industrial accident event happens only to colonies
    with at least 30 factories, as described in the OSG. If it is set to 0, it
    can happen to any colony, as is actually the case in MOO 1.3.

council_years : 0..32767, 25
  - Number of years between Galactic Council meetings.
    Zero means the Council never gathers.

trait1_* : 0..5, ?
  - Starting personality type table for each race.
    The type is chosen randomly from the table when stating a new game.
    The values are: 0 = Xenophobix, 1 = Ruthless, 2 = Aggressive,
    3 = Erratic, 4 = Honorable, 5 = Pacifistic.

trait2_* : 0..5, ?
  - Starting racial objective table for each race.
    The objective is chosen randomly from the table when stating a new game.
    The values are: 0 = Diplomat, 1 = Militarist, 2 = Expansionist,
    3 = Technologist, 4 = Industrialist, 5 = Ecologist.

crystal_* : ?, ?
amoeba_* : ?, ?
guardian_* : ?, ?
  - The index of these space monster tables is the difficulty level.

ngt_*_* : 0..255, ?
  - New game research list limitations for each field and race.
    Table index corresponds to tech level, for example ngt_we_meklar item 32
    controls Gauss Autocannon research availability for Meklars.
    The value 1 means the tech is never added, f.ex Silicoids & colony tech.
    The value 2 means the tech is always added. (Unused by default.)
    The bits 2..7 (values 4, 8, ...) are used for groups of essential techs;
    the research list must contain at least one of the techs with a given
    bit set. (Bit 2 / value 4 is the only one used by default.)

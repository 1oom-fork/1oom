# This is an example PBXIN file.
# Lines starting with # are comments. Empty lines are ignored.

# PBXIN files are used by 1oom_pbxmake to make PBX files.
# PBX files are patch files that replace LBX data or not-really-constants.
# Think of a MOO1 version of Doom WAD files (no scripts, though).

# The format of the non-comment lines is:
# 0,"pbx name"
# 1,pbx_description.txt
# 2,filename.lbx,itemnumber,replacementfile.bin"
# 3,string_id,itemnumber,"new text"
# 4,number_id,itemnumber,value[,value]*"

# Type 0 item is the PBX name. One per PBX, one line only. Keep it 7-bit ASCII.
0,"Example PBX file"

# Type 1 item is the PBX description. One per PBX. Can be long. Keep it 7-bit ASCII.
1,long_description.txt

# Tip: any included file could also be entered as a C-like string, f.ex
#1,"This is just a PBX example.\nGet the latest version from www.example.org/pbx\nHave fun!"


# Type 2 is a LBX patch.
# The item "itemnumber" in the LBX file is replaced with the given file whenever the
# game (or UI) asks for it. The LBX file itself is untouched.

# Replace the main menu logo with newlogo.bin.
2,v11.lbx,0,newlogo.bin
# Replace ship #4 graphics with newshipgfx.bin.
2,ships.lbx,4,newshipgfx.bin
# Only the native MOO1 LBX GFX format is supported.
# Use 1oom_gfxconv to convert pictures to the native format.

# Replace the battle music with something fitting.
2,music.lbx,8,D_RUNNIN.mid
# Replace the "click" sound.
2,soundfx.lbx,0x24,ping.wav
# Tip: hex numbers are supported. Unfortunately, so are octal; 012 == 10 == 0xa.
# Currently supported music formats: MIDI, XMID (used in MOO1 and MOM), FLAC, Ogg Vorbis
# Currently supported sound formats: WAV, VOC


# Type 3 is a string replacement.
# Run "1oom_classic_sdl1 -dumpstr" to get all the strings in copy/paste-friendly format.
# The "itemnumber" is 0 for non-table items. Indices start at 0.
# Let's change the main menu quit item:
3,mm_quit,0,"GTFO"
# Let's honor an another early 90's classic:
3,tbl_race,0,"Hunam"
# Example of changing an other item in the same table:
3,tbl_race,9,"Google"
# New strings may be longer than the original, but excessive length may break the UI.


# Type 4 is a number replacement.
# Run "1oom_classic_sdl1 -dumpnum" to get all the numbers in copy/paste-friendly format.
# The "itemnumber" is 0 for non-table items. Indices start at 0.
# Multiple items of a table can be changed in one line.
# Change the star gate cost:
4,stargate_cost,0,6000
# Tweak the large (2) and huge (3) hull space:
4,st_hull_space,2,1275,4850
# Tip: hex numbers are supported. Unfortunately, so are octal; 012 == 10 == 0xa.
# See doc/list_pbxnum.txt for more information.


# Use "1oom_pbxmake example_pbxin.txt example.pbx" to make the PBX file.
# (...although first you need to provide the missing files or comment the lines out.)
# Then "1oom_classic_sdl1 -file example.pbx" to try it out.
# "1oom_lbxview_sdl1 -file example.pbx" also works for viewing the LBX replacements.

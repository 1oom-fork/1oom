1oom_gfxconv is a tool for converting GFX for use in PBX files.

Usage:
    1oom_gfxconv [OPTIONS] OUT.BIN IN.PCX|=WxHcC [INn.PCX]*
    1oom_gfxconv -d IN.BIN
Options:
    -f       Make format 1 binary (only council.lbx item 1)
    -i       All independent frames (winlose.lbx items 1-...)
    -e N     Extra independent frame (embassy.lbx items 2-...)
    -n N     Set number of frames (default N = number of input files)
    -l N     Set loop frame
    -p F N   Include palette ; First, Number of colors
    -d       Dump converted file for debugging

The filenames "=WxHcC" are interpreted to be images of size W x H consisting of
the color C.

If the number of frames set with -n N is greater than the amount of input files,
the missing files are assumed to be the same as the last given file.

Examples:
    1oom_gfxconv title.bin title_screen.pcx
        - convert title_screen.pcx to title.bin

    1oom_gfxconv shipfoo.bin z_ships2_49_00*.pcx
        - convert the animation in z_ships2_49_00*.pcx to shipfoo.bin
          (hopefully your CLI will sort the files properly)

    1oom_gfxconv -p 0 256 foo.bin foo.pcx
        - convert foo.pcx to foo.bin
        - include the full palette

    1oom_gfxconv -e 2 out.bin z_embassy_04_*.pcx
        - convert the animation in z_embassy_04_*.pcx to out.bin
          (hopefully your CLI will sort the files properly)
        - declare frame 2 as independent (as in embassy.lbx items 2-...)

    1oom_gfxconv -n 48 emptyvortex.bin =320x200c13
        - create 48 frames of 320x200 color 13 to emptyvortex.bin

    1oom_gfxconv -d out.bin
        - dump out.bin for debugging

FAQ:
Q: ...wait. PCX?
A: Yes. Suitably 1993. If your graphics program does not support it,
   go get GraphicsMagick or something.

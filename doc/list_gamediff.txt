This is an incomplete list of game differences in comparision to v1.3.
See doc/list_pbxnum.txt for optional game differences.
See doc/usage_classic.txt for UI differences.

Much of this file is based on the readme from the unofficial v1.40m patch.

- the game makes an undo save (slot 8) on every next turn click, run with -noundo if you do not want this
- multiple fleets sent to same destination on the same turn are combined if they have the same speed
- fixed "bug" where on a given year only one scouted artifact planets gave new tech
- the number of build finished messages per turn is no longer limited to 10 per category
- fixed weird behaviour when space monsters attack colonized Orion

- annoying bug / cheat when a fleet with bioweapons automatically bombed an enemy planet while orbiting is gone for good
- entering the general "threaten / break treaty" dialogue no more equals to a large temporary diplomatic penalty
- the discovery percentages on tech screen are no more only 1/2 of the true probability of a tech hit
- Psilon leader "Zygot  " name correction (extra whitespace trimmed from all names)
- breaking a NAP / alliance no more positively contributes to your relations with the AIs
- 8th stargate bug corrected (no ship maintenance overflow)

- changes in Classic+ AI:
    - a small issue concerning the change in AI defense and ship production when too many MBases on a planet has been corrected

- the game has multiplayer (only local/hotseat for now); multiplayer differences to single player:
    - player diplomat is always up for audience except during the final war
    - when asked by other player to join a treaty, a player can ask for tech to sweeten the deal from those the spies have reported to exist
    - each player can accept/refuse the council ruling; the final war alliances are based on refusals

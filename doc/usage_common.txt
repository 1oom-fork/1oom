This document describes things common for all the programs.

This file is based on the OpenXcom 1.0 README, except s/folder/directory/g like
a civilized person.


1. LBX files
=============

1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files.
See doc/lbxmd5.txt for the expected MD5 sums.

The LBX file can be in a different directory as the executable.
You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-data <path>" when running 1oom. The given path is saved
to the configuration file.

The LBX files are first looked for in the directory specified with
"-data <path>". If not found there, the following subsections apply.

1.1. Windows, MSDOS
--------------------

1oom will check the directory of the executable and
the "data" directory inside it.

1.2 Unix (Linux)
-----------------

According to the XDG standard, 1oom will also check the
following directories:

- $XDG_DATA_HOME/1oom
- $XDG_DATA_DIRS/1oom

Or if those variables aren't available:

- ~/.local/share/1oom
- /usr/share/1oom
- .

Choose whichever you prefer.


2. Configuration
=================

1oom is configured via command-line arguments or editing the
configuration file. Each program has a separate configuration file (if any).

2.1. User Directory
--------------------

1oom creates a User directory with all the user savegames and
options in one of the following paths:

- <game directory> (win32, msdos)
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/1oom (Unix)
- ~/.config/1oom (Unix)

You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-user <path>" when running 1oom. Note that unlike "-data"
the setting is not saved in the configuration file.

2.2. What is not saved
-----------------------

Most options set via command-line arguments are saved to the configuration
file (if any). The notable exceptions are:

    -c          Config filename in the config file? Too meta
    -cro        Can not write "do not write config" to config
    -user       Config file is in user directory
    -(no)log    Log is opened before reading config
    -file

3.1. -new
----------

Whenever a new game is started, the log displays a line such as:
    Game: new game -new 621:0x5:4:0x3f5e5b32:1 -nga 0

The alphanumeric jumble is a game seed. It can be given to -new to start
a new game with the same galaxy and opponents.

The game seed format is OPT:RACES:BANNERS:GSEED:HUMANS where
    OPT is PLAYERS*100+GALAXYSIZE*10+DIFFICULTY
      PLAYERS is 2..6
      GALAXYSIZE is 0..3 = small..huge
      DIFFICULTY is 0..4 = simple..impossible
      default same as last new game
    RACES is PLAYERnRACE*(0x10^n), n=0..5
      0 = random
      1 = human
      2 = mrrshan
      3 = silicoid
      4 = sakkra
      5 = psilon
      6 = alkari
      7 = klackon
      8 = bulrathi
      9 = meklar
      a = darlok
      default 0 (all random)
    BANNERS is PLAYERnBANNER*(10^n), n=0..5
      0 = random
      1 = blue
      2 = green
      3 = purple
      4 = red
      5 = white
      6 = yellow
      default 0 (all random)
    GSEED is a 32 bit galaxy seed or 0 for random
      default 0
    HUMANS is PLAYERnISHUMAN*(10^n), n=0..5
      default 1 (player 1 is human, others AI)

Omitting a value sets it to the default one.
Some examples:

    -new 634
        * 6 player / huge / impossible game as a random race

    -new :0x7
        * player / size / difficulty same as last new game
        * as klackon

    -new :
        * player / size / difficulty same as last new game
        * as random race

    -new 634:0x162
        * 6 player / huge / impossible game as a random race
        * (2) as mrrshan, against (6) alkari and (1) human, others random

    -new 621:0x5:4:0x3f5e5b32:1
        * 6 player game in (2) large galaxy with (1) easy difficulty
        * player 1 race is (5) psilon, others random
        * player 1 banner is (4) red, others random
        * galaxy and random races/banners based on seed 0x3f5e5b32
        * player 1 is human, others AI

    -new 634:0x15533a
        * 6 player / huge / impossible game
        * as (a) darlok, against (1) human, (5) psilon, psilon,
          (3) silicoid and silicoid

    -new 304:0x48:25::11
        * 3 player / small / impossible game
        * player 1 is (5) white (8) bulrathi,
          player 2 is (2) green (8) sakkra,
          player 3 is random
        * players 1 and 2 are human

3.2. -nga
----------

The -nga command line parameters selects the AI type to use when starting
a new game via -new. The values 0 and 1 correspond to Classic and Classic+,
respectively.

3.3. -file
-----------

Unlike Doom, the "-file" part needs to added for each PBX file.
Like Doom, the given PBX filenames are not stored anywhere and must be given
with -file whenever the PBX files are to be used.

3.4. -ruleset
--------------

The ruleset option currently allows the values "1.3" (the default) or "fixbugs".
The 1.3 mode closely follows the latest official release of the game, with some
of the worst bugs fixed, such as the dreaded negative fleet bug.

The fixbugs mode fixes further bugs and odd behaviors. Running the fixbugs
ruleset is equivalent to loading a PBX file compiled from pbxin_fixbugs.txt.
However, unlike PBX files, the ruleset choice is stored.

PBX files override the chosen ruleset.


4. Optional features
================

4.1. Planetary governor
------------------------

The planetary governor is provided as an option for reducing micromanagement.
It is enabled/disabled for each planet individually. The planet list
highlights governed planets.

The classic UI has a new governor screen which is accessed by clicking on
the Pop text or pressing V key. The governor screen allows:
- Setting a target amount of missile bases.
- Choosing where to spend remaining points: research, ships or reserve.
- Allowing the governors to build stargates.
- Setting the universal ecology mode:
    - grow population before spending of defense
    - grow population before last step
    - never use resources to grow population
    - do not decrease ecology spending
    - do not touch ecology spending
- Readjusting all governed planets.
- Applying the spend remaining choice to all planets.

The governor works as follows:
- First, remember the old ecology slider position.
- Then if mode is not "don't touch", set ecology to minimum that avoids waste.
- Then if mode is "don't decrease" and old value was larger, restore it.
- Then move industry slider until maximum or reserve achieved.
- Then if mode is not "do not touch", set ecology to terraform.
- Then if mode is "grow before defense", set ecology to grow population.
- Then set defense to upgrade bases or build shield.
- Then increase defense to build up to target amount of missile bases.
- Then if technology is present and governor is allowed to build stargates,
  set shipbuilding to minimum required to build one.
- Then if mode is "grow before last", set ecology to grow population.
- If all of the above are finished, do research, ship building or reserve.

The governor adjusts the sliders only at the following times:
- When enabling the governor by clicking the planet name.
- When readjusting all planets via the governor screen.
- After a turn, just before any "Planetary spending ratios may ..." messages.

These rules have some implications:
- The governor can be overridden by adjusting the sliders manually; the
  governor takes over again at the next turn.
- Adjusting governor settings, tax, spying, security or sending reserves is not
  reflected on the sliders on the same turn. Either disable/enable the governor
  for each affected planet or use the governor screen to readjust all the
  governed planets for the next turn.
- The "don't" modes still get the same automatic ecology adjustments as the
  non-governed planets.
- The governor copes poorly with random events, especially plague.

4.2. Space combat autoresolve
------------------------------

The space combat autoresolve is provided as an option for skipping battles.
Pressing the Auto button results in the battle beings fought as if the player(s)
pressed Auto right after starting combat.
The Retreat button works as if the (human) player(s) pressed Retreat at the
earliest and every opportunity.

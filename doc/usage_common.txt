This document describes things common for all the programs.

This file is based on the OpenXcom 1.0 README, except s/folder/directory/g like
a civilized person.


1. LBX files
=============

1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files.
See doc/lbxmd5.txt for the expected MD5 sums.

The LBX file can be in a different directory as the executable.
You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-data <path>" when running 1oom. The given path is saved
to the configuration file.

The LBX files are first looked for in the directory specified with
"-data <path>". If not found there, the following subsections apply.

1.1. Windows, MSDOS
--------------------

1oom will check the directory of the executable.

1.2 Unix (Linux)
-----------------

According to the XDG standard, 1oom will also check the
following directories:

- $XDG_DATA_HOME/1oom
- $XDG_DATA_DIRS/1oom

Or if those variables aren't available:

- ~/.local/share/1oom
- /usr/share/1oom
- .

Choose whichever you prefer.


2. Configuration
=================

1oom is configured via command-line arguments or editing the
configuration file. Each program has a separate configuration file (if any).

2.1. User Directory
--------------------

1oom creates a User directory with all the user savegames and
options in one of the following paths:

- <game directory> (win32, msdos)
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/1oom (Unix)
- ~/.config/1oom (Unix)

You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-user <path>" when running 1oom. Note that unlike "-data"
the setting is not saved in the configuration file.

2.2. What is not saved
-----------------------

Most options set via command-line arguments are saved to the configuration
file (if any). The notable exceptions are:

    -c          Config filename in the config file? Too meta
    -cro        Can not write "do not write config" to config
    -user       Config file is in user directory
    -(no)log    Log is opened before reading config


3. Command-line arguments

3.1. -new
----------

Whenever a new game is started, the log displays a line such as:
    Game: new game -new 621:0x5:4:0x3f5e5b32:1

The alphanumeric jumble is a game seed. It can be given to -new to start
a new game with the same galaxy and opponents.

The game seed format is OPT:RACES:BANNERS:GSEED:HUMANS where
    OPT is PLAYERS*100+GALAXYSIZE*10+DIFFICULTY
      PLAYERS is 2..6
      GALAXYSIZE is 0..3 = small..huge
      DIFFICULTY is 0..4 = simple..impossible
      default same as last new game
    RACES is PLAYERnRACE*(0x10^n), n=0..5
      0 = random
      1 = human
      2 = mrrshan
      3 = silicoid
      4 = sakkra
      5 = psilon
      6 = alkari
      7 = klackon
      8 = bulrathi
      9 = meklar
      a = darlok
      default 0 (all random)
    BANNERS is PLAYERnBANNER*(10^n), n=0..5
      0 = random
      1 = blue
      2 = green
      3 = purple
      4 = red
      5 = white
      6 = yellow
      default 0 (all random)
    GSEED is a 32 bit galaxy seed or 0 for random
      default 0
    HUMANS is PLAYERnISHUMAN*(10^n), n=0..5
      default 1 (player 1 is human, others AI)

Omitting a value sets it to the default one.
Some examples:

    -new 634
        * 6 player / huge / impossible game as a random race

    -new :0x7
        * player / size / difficulty same as last new game
        * as klackon

    -new :
        * player / size / difficulty same as last new game
        * as random race

    -new 634:0x162
        * 6 player / huge / impossible game as a random race
        * (2) as mrrshan, against (6) alkari and (1) human, others random

    -new 621:0x5:4:0x3f5e5b32:1
        * 6 player game in (2) large galaxy with (1) easy difficulty
        * player 1 race is (5) psilon, others random
        * player 1 banner is (4) red, others random
        * galaxy and random races/banners based on seed 0x3f5e5b32
        * player 1 is human, others AI

    -new 634:0x15533a
        * 6 player / huge / impossible game
        * as (a) darlok, against (1) human, (5) psilon, psilon,
          (3) silicoid and silicoid

    -new 304:0x48:25::11
        * 3 player / small / impossible game
        * player 1 is (5) white (8) bulrathi,
          player 2 is (2) green (8) sakkra,
          player 3 is random
        * players 1 and 2 are human


4. New features
================

4.1. Space combat autoresolve
------------------------------

The space combat autoresolve is provided as an option for skipping battles.
Pressing the Auto button results in the battle beings fought as if the player(s)
pressed Auto right after starting combat.
The Retreat button works as if the (human) player(s) pressed Retreat at the
earliest and every opportunity.

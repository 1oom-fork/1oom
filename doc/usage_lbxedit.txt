1oom_lbxedit is a tool for editing LBX files.

There is very little reason to use this as PBX files are a nondestructive way
to replace LBX contents.

Usage:
    1oom_lbxedit [OPTIONS] d IN.LBX [OUTPREFIX]
    1oom_lbxedit [OPTIONS] m LBXIN.TXT OUT.LBX
    1oom_lbxedit [OPTIONS] e IN.LBX OUT.BIN ITEMNUM
    1oom_lbxedit [OPTIONS] r FILE.LBX IN.BIN|0 ITEMNUM
Commands:
    d   Dump LBX file to LBXIN + bin files
    m   Make LBX file from LBXIN + bin files
    e   Extract item from LBX file
    r   Replace item in LBX file
Options:
    -w          (d, r) Write files
    -o OUT.LBX  (r) Set output LBX filename

In d and r modes: If the -w option is not given then no files are written.

In d mode: The input filename without the .LBX extension (if any) is used
for the output prefix if none is given.

The input bin filename "0" is interpreted as a zero length file.

Examples:
    1oom_lbxedit d ships.lbx
        - show ships.pbx contents in LBXIN format

    1oom_lbxedit -w d ships.lbx
        - write ships.lbx contents to ships.lbxin and ships_*.bin

    1oom_lbxedit -w d ships.lbx d/foo
        - write ships.lbx contents to d/foo.lbxin and d/foo_*.bin

    1oom_lbxedit m foo.lbxin bar.lbx
        - build bar.lbx from foo.lbxin the files it refers to

    1oom_lbxedit e ships.lbx ship4.bin 4
        - extract item 4 in ships.lbx to ship4.bin

    1oom_lbxedit -o new.lbx -w r ships.lbx ship4.bin 4
        - create new.lbx from ships.lbx with ship4.bin as item 4

    1oom_lbxedit -w r ships.lbx ship4.bin 4
        - replace item 4 in ships.lbx with ship4.bin

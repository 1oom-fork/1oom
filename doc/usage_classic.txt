1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen".

The config file item "ui.uiscale" (set via the -uiscale command-line option)
is an integer scaling factor for the whole UI except:
- mouse cursor
- galaxy movement screen map
- sliders
The default value is 1 for that classic 320x200 feeling. Larger values allow
more of the galaxy to be viewed without scrolling. Mouse wheel can be used
to adjust the scaling of the galaxy movement screen map.

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Smoother galaxy movement screen scrolling
- Random race / banner
- Local multiplayer (use -new or -uiextra to start a game)
- Lowercase allowed in save names
- Load Game screen uses numbers as hotkeys for slots
- Objects with hotkeys can be navigated to using cursor keys
- Mouse wheel can be used to adjust sliders and scroll lists
- Mouse wheel on planet name in the galaxy movement screen changes planet
- Clicking the portraits in Races screen brings Report page
- Ind slider no longer shows 0.N/y when at max factories
- Bases can be scrapped by clicking on the Bases text

The config file item "ui.uiextra" (set via the -uiextra command-line option)
enables the following extra UI features:
- Continue and Undo saves can be chosen in the Load Game screen
- New Game screen allows setting opponent race/banner/names and AI/human flag
- Report screen shows name of AI leaders, Map screen shows current year
- Fleet deployment shows the amount of available ships
- Sending fewer than all ships does not deselect the orbit fleet
- Clicking a selected destination star again works as Accept for fleet send etc
- Summary of forces shown before ship combat
- New Auto button for space combat autoresolve
- Pressing = on the Tech screen adjusts only the unlocked sliders

See doc/list_gamediff.txt for a list of differences in the game itself.

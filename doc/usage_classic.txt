1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hotkeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game or when F10 is pressed while in the "galaxy movement screen".

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Random race / banner
- Local multiplayer (use -new or -uiextra to start a game)
- Lowercase allowed in save names
- Load Game screen uses numbers as hotkeys for slots
- Objects with hotkeys can be navigated to using cursor keys
- Mouse wheel can be used to scroll lists and adjust many things
- Ind slider no longer shows 0.N/y when at max factories
- Bases can be scrapped by clicking on the Bases text
- Clicking cycles selection of overlapping fleets

The config file item "ui.uiextra" (set via the -uiextra command-line option)
enables the following extra UI features:
- Continue and Undo saves can be chosen in the Load Game screen
- New Game screen allows setting opponent race/banner/names and AI/human flag
- Clicking the portraits in Races screen brings Report page
- Report screen shows name of AI leaders, Map screen shows current year
- Fleet deployment shows the amount of available ships
- Sending fewer than all ships does not deselect the orbit fleet
- Clicking a selected destination star again works as Accept for fleet send etc
- Eco slider shows fractional population growth if growth is less than 10
- Summary of forces shown before ship combat
- New Auto and Retreat buttons for space combat autoresolve

The config file item "ui.uifixbugs" (set via the -uifixbugs command-line option)
enables the following UI bug fixes:
- Pressing = on the Tech screen adjusts only the unlocked sliders

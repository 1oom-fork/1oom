1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-[] to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-[] to adjust music volume
- Alt-[] to adjust window size
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen". 1oom does autosave the "new game" (save slot 9)
when starting a new game.

The config file item "ui.uiscale" (set via the -uiscale command-line option)
is an integer scaling factor for the whole UI except:
- mouse cursor
- galaxy movement screen map
- sliders
The default value is 1 for that classic 320x200 feeling. Larger values allow
more of the galaxy to be viewed without scrolling. Mouse wheel can be used
to adjust the scaling of the galaxy movement screen map.

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Smoother galaxy movement screen scrolling
- Galaxy movement screen scrolling speed is adjustable (-uismscroll)
- Random race / banner
- Local multiplayer (use -new or -uiextra to start a game)
- Lowercase allowed in save names
- Load Game screen uses numbers as hotkeys for slots
- Objects with hotkeys can be navigated to using cursor keys
- Mouse wheel can be used to scroll lists and adjust many things
- Mouse wheel on planet name in the galaxy movement screen changes planet

- When using cursor keys, the mouse position is calculated taking into account
  the mouse icon offset
- The cursor key behavior is more intuitive

  the behavior is more predictable

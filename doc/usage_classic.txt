1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hotkeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-[] to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-[] to adjust music volume
- Alt-[] to adjust window size
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen". 1oom does autosave the "new game" (save slot 9)
when starting a new game.

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Smoother galaxy movement screen scrolling

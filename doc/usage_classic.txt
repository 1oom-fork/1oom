1oom is a clone of the classic DOS game "Master of Orion" (MicroProse, 1993).
1oom is Free Software (GPLv2), see COPYING.

1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen".

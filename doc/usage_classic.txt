1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume
- Ctrl-F5 saves a screenshot
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen".

The config file item "ui.uiscale" (set via the -uiscale command-line option)
is an integer scaling factor for the whole UI except:
- mouse cursor
- galaxy movement screen map
- sliders
The default value is 1 for that classic 320x200 feeling. Larger values allow
more of the galaxy to be viewed without scrolling. Mouse wheel can be used
to adjust the scaling of the galaxy movement screen map.

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Smoother galaxy movement screen scrolling
- Galaxy movement screen scrolling speed is adjustable (-uismscroll)
- Random race / banner
- Local multiplayer (use -new or -uiextra to start a game)
- Lowercase allowed in save names
- Load Game screen uses numbers as hotkeys for slots
- Objects with hotkeys can be navigated to using cursor keys
- Mouse wheel can be used to scroll lists and adjust many things

- Eco slider shows Clean/+N Pop past T-Form on a full planet
- Clicking cycles selection of overlapping fleets
- The keys UHJK scroll the galaxy movement screen map
- Planets can be searched for by pressing the / key
- Planets can be tagged with Ctrl-1-9 and recalled with 1-9
- Pressing = or # in the galaxy movement screen transfers reserve for
  one round of production (with uiextra also transfers back)

The config file item "ui.uiextra" (set via the -uiextra command-line option)
or pressing Alt-X in the main menu enables the following extra UI features:
- Continue, Undo and Init saves can be chosen in the Load Game screen

  All local settings are also reachable directly over the planet interface.

  through the reserve spending modes for the planet. The modes are "none"
  (never), "buildup" (only during buildup) and "always" (useful for Ultra Rich

- The plantary production field indicates whether the planet currently receives
  reserve spending (yellow = none, red = partial, while = full). The same
  colors are also used in the Planets screen.
- Clicking on the production field in the Planets screen resets the allocated
  reserve to zero or (when it is already zero) directly opens the reserve
  transfer dialog.
- Nebula planets show "NEB" in their shields field and have a purple instead
  of a red frame around their picture

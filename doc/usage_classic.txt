1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen".

The config file item "ui.uiscale" (set via the -uiscale command-line option)
is an integer scaling factor for the whole UI except:
- mouse cursor
- galaxy movement screen map
- sliders
The default value is 1 for that classic 320x200 feeling. Larger values allow
more of the galaxy to be viewed without scrolling. Mouse wheel can be used
to adjust the scaling of the galaxy movement screen map.

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Smoother galaxy movement screen scrolling
- Galaxy movement screen scrolling speed is adjustable (-uismscroll)
- Random race / banner
- Local multiplayer (use -new or -uiextra to start a game)
- Lowercase allowed in save names
- Load Game screen uses numbers as hotkeys for slots
- Objects with hotkeys can be navigated to using cursor keys
- Mouse wheel can be used to scroll lists and adjust many things
- Mouse wheel on planet name in the galaxy movement screen changes planet
- Space bar works as a generic dismiss message key (Continue, ...)
- In Tech screen Tab runs through tech fields
- Clicking the portraits in Races screen brings Report page
- In Races screen the keys 1-5 correspond to clicking the portraits
- Right-clicking on the ship image or Ships button cycles the other way

- Bases can be scrapped by clicking on the Bases text

    - The ship production selection can be set everywhere
    - Relocation can be (un)set for all planets
    - "X has finished ..." messages can be filtered
- Completing terraforming generates a message (which is filtered by default)
- After running through the Next turn phase and messages the game recenters on
  your last planet of choice
- Clicking on #, Name, etc on Planets screen sorts the list
- Clicking on Station or ship names on Fleet screen sorts the list

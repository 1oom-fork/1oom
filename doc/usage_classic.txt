1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-[] to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-[] to adjust music volume
- Alt-[] to adjust window size
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen". 1oom does autosave the "new game" (save slot 9)
when starting a new game.
An incorrect answer in the copy protection dialog does not delete save slot 7.

The config file item "ui.uiscale" (set via the -uiscale command-line option)
is an int scaling factor for the whole UI except galaxy movement screen map.
The default value is 1 for that classic 320x200 feeling. Larger values allow
more of the galaxy to be viewed without scrolling. Mouse wheel can be used
to adjust the scaling of the galaxy movement screen map.

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Smoother galaxy movement screen scrolling
- Galaxy movement screen scrolling speed is adjustable (-uismscroll)
- Random race / banner

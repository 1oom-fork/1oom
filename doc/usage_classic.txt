################

1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hoykeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-[/] to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-[/] to adjust music volume
- Ctrl-F5 saves a screenshot
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game via Game -> Quit or when F10 is pressed while in the "control screen" /
"galaxy movement screen".

Most of the settings are now available in the main menu.
- Menu items can be adjusted using the +/- keys, mouse wheel
  and left/right mouse buttons
- Pressing hotkey works as +, pressing Shift + hotkey works as '-'

The config file item "ui.uiscale" (set via the -uiscale command-line option)
is an integer scaling factor for the whole UI except:
- galaxy movement screen map
- sliders
The default value is 1 for that classic 320x200 feeling. Larger values allow
more of the galaxy to be viewed without scrolling. Mouse wheel can be used
to adjust the scaling of the galaxy movement screen map.

The config file item "ui.space_combat_autoresolve" (set via
the -spacecombatautoresolve command-line option or uiextra options menu)
enables the following features:
- Summary of forces shown before ship combat
- New Auto and Retreat buttons for space combat autoresolve

  the normal range of the fleet

  to select a planet on mouse hover

- Planets can be tagged with Ctrl-1-9 and recalled with 1-9

	- No elections
	- No random events
	- Faster/Slower research rate
	- Precap tohit (from fixbugs ruleset)
		MOO1 adds To Hit bonuses after capping defense. This
		results in high defense being less effective against
		high tech missiles.
	- No tohit accumulation (from fixbugs ruleset)
		MOO1 accumulates weapon To Hit bonuses while firing
		the four weapons slots. This results in Hyper-X or 
		better missiles or Megabolt Cannon in slots 1..3
		affecting the accuracy of a beam weapon in slot 4.

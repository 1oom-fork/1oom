1oom_classic_* replicate the 1993 UI.

See doc/usage_common.txt for the data/user file locations and command-line
arguments.

The UI controls like the original. Consult the game manual and the readme.txt
from v1.3. This document describes only the differences.

New hotkeys:
- Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input
- Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving)
- Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume
- Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume
- Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode

Unlike the original, 1oom does not autosave the "continue game" (save slot 7)
when starting a new game or every N turns. It only saves it when quitting the
game or when F10 is pressed while in the "galaxy movement screen".

The following new UI features are always enabled/available:
- Random race / banner

  sense: Alt+m, Alt+c, Alt+r

- Planets can be searched for by pressing the / key

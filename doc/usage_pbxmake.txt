1oom_pbxmake is a tool for creating PBX files.

PBX files are patch files that replace LBX data or not-really-constants.
Think of a MOO1 version of Doom WAD files (no scripts, though).

Usage: 1oom_pbxmake PBXIN.TXT OUT.PBX

See doc/pbxin_example.txt for the PBXIN.TXT format and example use.
See doc/list_pbxnum.txt for description of some of the number replacements.
See doc/format_pbx.txt for the OUT.PBX format. (For devs. Users can ignore.)

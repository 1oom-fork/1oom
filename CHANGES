1oom-fork-v1.7.4
----------------

Ui Main Menu -> Game -> Custom Game:
- The 'Fix factory cost' option (now enabled by default in new games):
  Continue building cheap factories after researching 
  the 'Improved Robotic Controls' tech. This also changes
  the refit cost to match the value described in OSG.
- The 'Waste calc fix' option (from fixbugs ruleset)
  (now enabled by default in new games): Fix waste calculation.
  MOO1 adds waste twice: first using a perfectly sensible formula
  and then a baffling one. The waste elimination cost is calculated
  in between. The second amount added is often negative due to the
  waste amount not being limited. This is why Silicoid planets
  end up with 0 waste. Other races only see the effect when setting
  the Eco slider below Clean.
  
AI:
- Fix AI transport range

UI Starmap:
- Fix slider behavior

1oom-fork-v1.7.3
----------------

Ui Main Menu -> Game -> Custom Game:
- The 'Fix population growth' option
  (now enabled by default in new games):
  Do not add Population Tenths twice. MOO1 adds
  Population Tenths twice when calculating population
  growth. This results in nonlinear changes of growth value.
  
Ui Main Menu -> Interface
- Random News (on/off)
		
Ui Starmap:
- Eco slider can show 'MAX'
- Removed alt-strings (now available in search UI as slash-commands):
	/alt-string
	
Galaxy generator:
- Fixed some bugs in the new galaxy_gen logic
	
Fixed static build scripts for SDL1 and SDL2

1oom-fork-v1.7.2
----------------

Ui Main Menu -> Game -> Custom Game:
- Galaxy generator:
	- The 'Fix homes too close' option checks the distance
	  between all homeworlds instead of only 2 of them
	  This option disables Moo v1.3 check for good planets nearby
	- The "Fix satellites" option ensures that each homeworld
	  has a suitable planet next to it instead of only 2 of them
	- The "Good satellites" option ensures that each satellite
	  will be at least not bad quality

- Changed 'Players' option text
- Changed 'Galaxy seed' option text

Ui Starmap:
- Fixed Alt+m grid limits

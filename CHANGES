1oom-fork-v1.8.0
----------------

Disclaimer:
This release is an interim release.
I'm posting this to give people the opportunity to enjoy a relatively
high quality build that still contains many bugs inherited from v1.0.
Previous 1oom-fork versions are now considered defective.
It is recommended to close the old version of 1oom-fork and delete
config file if you want to run this version.
Saved games from an older version of 1oom-fork may not work or refuse to load
if you try them from this version.

This (v1.8.0) version of fork does not change save game format compared to the
point when it's forked from Tapani-fork (9b9cf63...)
This version of fork is based on reworked version of Tapani-fork mixed with
reworked and filtered version of 1oom-fork-v1.7.6 (1oom-v1.0-rev-5)
The commit history is now can be used as detailed changelog

Summary:
- most of the 1oom-fork commits were rewritten from scratch with improvements
- removed or rewrote most of the later commits from the Tapani branch,
  with special attention to those that added bugs or problems for developers
- it is now possible to use absolute mouse in DOSBox on Andriod by enabling
  absolute mouse in both the game and DOSBox configurations
- most rule bug fixes is enabled and can only be disabled via PBX
- added UI Presets
This is not a complete list of changes

Bug reports are welcome

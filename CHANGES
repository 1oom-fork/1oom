Version 1.3.0
-------------

The following bugs fixed:
-	Fix ETA display if target enemy planet have stargate

The "fixbugs" ruleset has been partially added to the main game,
which changes the following rules:
- Max. number of weapons shown in the ship design weapon list is 64
	- Was 30 in MOO1
- Fix the Oracle Interface
	- In MOO1 the Oracle Interface does nothing to the target's shields
- Set Guardian repair rate for Hard/Impossible/Hopeless to 15%/30%/50%
	- Was 15%/0%/# in MOO1
- Only apply the industrial accident events to colonies with
  some industry (at least 30) as described in the OSG
- Fix transport redirection bug/cheat
	- In MOO1 transports can be redirected (given Hyperspace Communications)
	  to unexplored, reserve-fuel-needing and no-colony-for destinations
- Fix Star Gate fleet redirection bug/cheat
	- In MOO1 a fleet sent via Star Gate can be redirected to any other 
	  planet and the flight will take only 1 turn regardless of destination
	  The other way was also bugged: redirecting a fleet to a valid Star Gate
	  use situation did not end up in the fleet using the Star Gates
- Fix negative/32000 ship doom stack bug (was fixed in 1oom)
	- In MOO1 overflows in AI-AI battles can result in 32000 ship doom stacks
- Show news when Orion is first colonized
	- MOO1 has a news item for conquering Orion but never shows it
- Do not reload ship specials on Wait
	- MOO1 reloads ship specials when Wait is pressed.  This means it is
	  possible to use the Pulsars, Black Hole Generator, Automated repair
	  etc an unlimited number of times
- 2700 factories limit.
	- Was 2500 in MOO1 and is too low for Meklars

- Added as new game modes:
	- MOO v1.3 fair space combat:
		- Do not accumulate To Hit bonuses. MOO1 accumulates weapon
		  To Hit bonuses while firing the four weapons slots
		  This results in Hyper-X or better missiles or Megabolt Cannon
		  in slots 1..3 affecting the accuracy of a beam weapon in slot 4
	- Balanced space combat:
		- Includes MOO v1.3 fair space combat mode
		- Add To Hit bonus before capping defense to 95%.
		  MOO1 adds To Hit bonuses after capping defense
		  This results in high defense being less effective
		  against high tech missiles or Megabolt Cannons
- Balanced space combat is now default game mode for new games

1oom-v1.11.4
------------

This release inherits the simplified aspect ratio correction implementation
from Chocolate Doom (SDL2):

- Now only 2 modes are available, with and without correction
- In absolute mouse mode, adjusted mouse resolution to match aspect ratio
- Added correction of integer arithmetic of mouse jumps
- Aspect ratio correction is now enabled by default

1oom-v1.11.3
------------

- SDL1 is no longer supported and disabled by default
- Minor SDL2 fixes
- Fixed several significant bugs in the game engine to match the original

1oom-v1.11.2
------------

This release corrects several fundamental differences from the original:

- The behavior of ships with bio-weapons has been restored
- The code responsible for landing troops on a planet with zero population
  has been restored
- Restored original bugs in the pathfinding code on the battlefield
- Fixed the location of rocks near the planet
- Restored the sound effect of the Ships button on the star map
- Several AI diplomacy fixes moved to Classic+

1oom-v1.11.1
------------

This release contains a significant number of experimental features:

- Added several global research cost modifiers
- Main menu slightly sorted
- First tech cost fix (Classic+ AI) is now a separate rule
- Added the ability to lock the slider for all colonies of the same type
- Added some fixes for slider_respect_locks rule (still experimental)
- The distance hint has been replaced with a new Alt+o mode
- Added the ability to rename planets and ship designs
- Smoother scrolling of the star map is now optional

1oom-v1.11
----------

This release is almost completely identical to v1.10.6:

- lbxview: Fixed window update
- All 4 pages of the video buffer are now allocated as a solid piece of memory
  similar to the original, but this version has no padding, which may lead to
  rare, subtle graphic artifacts (will be fixed in future releases)
- Reverted one cumbersome fix related to video buffer overflow
- Some hidden AI fixes moved to Classic+ AI
- The Git tree has been cleaned and refined to make future changes easier

1oom-v1.10.6
------------

- Fixed a critical issue in Classic+ AI

1oom-v1.10.5
------------

- Planets UI: Added max population column as in 1.7.6
- AI: 4th colony curse fix is now a separate rule
- AI: Doom stack fix is now a separate rule and disabled by default

1oom-v1.10.4
------------

This release adds the ability to change sliders for all colonies
at once in one click:

- Added dialog box code
- Holding the Ctrl key while locking a colony slider allows you to lock sliders
  for all colonies at once
- Holding the Alt or Ctrl key while clicking on the frame with the slider value
  text allows you to adjust sliders for all colonies at once
- Most smart slider manipulations now depend on the slider_respects_locks rule,
  with the exception of the new technologies UI

1oom-v1.10.3
------------

This release is a general cleanup and improvement to the
game_update_eco_on_waste code:

- The old implementation of waste_adjust_fix has been replaced
with a simpler and clearer one, based on the original code
- Added slider_respects_locks rule, which prevents the functions
above from changing locked sliders

The changes above are in preparation for the introduction of
more extensive game controls. Bug reports are welcome.

1oom-v1.10.2
------------

- Added challenge mode (special difficulty map)
- Improved distance indicator

1oom-v1.10.1
------------

- Pressing g on the battlefield screen shows the grid

1oom-v1.10.0
------------

This release is the second interim release since v1.8.1, the goal
of which is to clean the code as much as possible from additions
that cause a large number of errors or are outdated.

List of positive changes:
- the RNG is non-deterministic by default
- implemented Improved Robotic Controls behavior close to OSG
- F4/F5 now cycles through enemy fleets, like in v1.7.6
- Eco slider can show "MAX", like in v1.7.6
- the map on the Map screen is now clickable
- added several vanilla rules that were "fixed" in v1.0
- more hidden rules from v1.0 have been added to the menu
- some smart features have been added/moved to cheats
- simplified implementation of the message filter

List of removed features after f1.8.1:
- governor
- extra menu (bottom-left corner)
- (Ctrl-)1-9 to tag/recall planet
- screenshot
- Game screen options overhaul
- X11 HW (unfinished)

Many simple changes of the same type or rollbacks of erroneous
changes have been grouped to simplify work with the history.
Some fixes have been confirmed by reverse engineering and are now
explicitly marked as 1oom typo fixes.

Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.


1oom-v1.9
---------

This release by default uses the original rules of the game as much
as 1oom v1.0 allowed and even better.

Summary:

- Fixed broken rebellions
- Rules settings menu options have been improved
- The bug that causes AI to build an obscenely large fleet is now
  a separate rule

  conflicted, or interfered with the development of the project
- A significant amount of useless 1oom code has been removed

Bug reports are welcome.


1oom-f1.8.1
-----------

This release is special. For the first time since the release of v1.0,

1oom-fork-v1.8.0
----------------

Disclaimer:
This release is an interim release.
I'm posting this to give people the opportunity to enjoy a relatively
high quality build that still contains many bugs inherited from v1.0.
Previous 1oom-fork versions are now considered defective.
It is recommended to close the old version of 1oom-fork and delete
config file if you want to run this version.
Saved games from an older version of 1oom-fork may not work or refuse to load
if you try them from this version.

This (v1.8.0) version of fork does not change save game format compared to the
point when it's forked from Tapani-fork (9b9cf63...)
This version of fork is based on reworked version of Tapani-fork mixed with
reworked and filtered version of 1oom-fork-v1.7.6 (1oom-v1.0-rev-5)
The commit history is now can be used as detailed changelog

Summary:
- most of the 1oom-fork commits were rewritten from scratch with improvements
- removed or rewrote most of the later commits from the Tapani branch,
  with special attention to those that added bugs or problems for developers
- it is now possible to use absolute mouse in DOSBox on Andriod by enabling
  absolute mouse in both the game and DOSBox configurations
- most rule bug fixes is enabled and can only be disabled via PBX
- added UI Presets
This is not a complete list of changes

Bug reports are welcome

1oom-fork-v1.7.6
----------------

The list of changes for this version of the fork is irrelevant, since
subsequent versions reject or modify most of the changes in order to
improve the quality of the project and its compliance with the original.

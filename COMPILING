Parameters for configure:
    CFLAGS
    SDL1_CFLAGS
    SDL1_LIBS
    SDL1MIXER_LIBS
    SDL2_CFLAGS
    SDL2_LIBS
    SDL2MIXER_LIBS


2. Preparing build tools
=========================

You'll need autotools, make and a C99 compiler.
You will most likely also want to have SDL development libraries.
Both SDL 1.2.x and SDL2.x are supported.
OpenGL libraries are highly recommended.

2.1. Compiling on Linux
===============================

If you want to use SDL1:
    aptitude install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

If you prefer SDL2:
    aptitude install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev

For better audio quality, also get libsamplerate.
    aptitude install libsamplerate-dev
    
For custom sound fonts support:
    aptitude install libfluidsynth-dev
	
You are now ready to configure and build 1oom as described in Section 3.

2.2. Compiling on Windows
==========================

To compile 1oom, you need a GNU build environment.

2.2.1. Compiling with MinGW
----------------------------

Note: This method is deprecated. Follow 2.2.2 if you want FluidSynth support.

Download and install mingw-get-setup.exe from: https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/

This will install a graphical package manager. Ensure that you have the latest autoconf,
automake and make versions available and also MSYS.

Download the SDL2 development libarary for MinGW from:
    https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases

Download the SDL2 mixer development library for MinGW from:
    https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases

Then unzip the two archives you downloaded.

Then, run:
    C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat

which gives you a UNIX-style command prompt with the correct PATHs already configured.

Then, go to the directory where you extracted SDL2 and enter:
    make native

Do the same for SDL2 Mixer.

You are now ready to configure and build 1oom as described in Section 3. When
running configure, pass the following options:
    ../configure --disable-hwalleg4

To run 1oom, place the *32-bit* versions of SDL2.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll in the
same directory as the binary.

2.2.2. Compiling with MSYS2
----------------------------

https://kilgoretroutmaskreplicant.gitlab.io/plain-html/howto_build_windows.html

For Windows 7, you can download the old version of MSYS2 here:
    https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/tag/2022-10-28

Note: Add the --enable-static flag for static build when you run ./configure.

To run 1oom with FluidSynth support, before building you need to install
the appropriate fluidsynth package in MSYS2 and copy the fluidsynth DLLs to
same directory as 1oom binary (even for static build).

3. Compiling 1oom
==================

The following needs to be run from the 1oom folder.

If you checked this out with git, do this first:
    autoreconf -fi

Make a build directory:
    mkdir build-native
    cd build-native

Then the usual:
    ../configure
    make -j 3

!!! You need the data files from the original Master of Orion to run 1oom. !!!

Actual install step is not needed:
    src/1oom_classic_sdl1 -data /path/to/moo
    src/1oom_classic_sdl2 -data /path/to/moo


4. Cross-compiling
===================

Something like this may work:
    mkdir build-win32d
    cd build-win32d
    ../configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32.shared

If the libraries are not found, try something like:
    ../configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32.shared
        SDL1_CFLAGS="`i686-w64-mingw32.shared-sdl-config --cflags`" \
        SDL1_LIBS="`i686-w64-mingw32.shared-sdl-config --libs`" \
        SDL1MIXER_LIBS="`i686-w64-mingw32.shared-pkg-config --libs SDL_mixer`" \
        SDL2_CFLAGS="`i686-w64-mingw32.shared-sdl2-config --cflags`" \
        SDL2_LIBS="`i686-w64-mingw32.shared-sdl2-config --libs`" \
        SDL2MIXER_LIBS="`i686-w64-mingw32.shared-pkg-config --libs SDL2_mixer`"

Good luck!

4.1. Unix to win32
===================

This is a quick guide to make a cross compiler based on MXE: http://mxe.cc/

First we build MXE:
    git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
    cd mxe
    make MXE_TARGETS='i686-w64-mingw32.shared' gcc sdl sdl_mixer sdl2 sdl2_mixer libsamplerate readline
(or i686-w64-mingw32.static if you want static binaries, or maybe both)

Edit your .bashrc, .profile or equivalent and add/edit:
    export PATH="/MXE_path/usr/bin:$PATH"
(If you are unsure of the MXE_path, run pwd.)
Run the export line on the current terminal to set the PATH for this session.

Now to cross compile 1oom:
    cd ~/path/to/1oom
    mkdir build-win32d
    cd build-win32d
    ../configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32.shared && make -j 3

If you want to make distributable packages of .shared compiles:
    mkdir extrabindist_win32
    cp /MXE_path/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.shared/bin/{SDL*,libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll,libsamplerate.dll} extrabindist_win32
(the list may be incomplete; run the EXEs in wine and see the error messages)


4.2. Unix to msdos
===================

This is a quick guide to cross compile a MSDOS binary.

First get a cross compiler:
    git clone https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp.git
    ...
(or just grab a prebuilt one from the GitHub page)

Edit your .bashrc, .profile or equivalent and add/edit:
    export PATH="/djgpp_path/bin:$PATH"
Run the export line on the current terminal to set the PATH for this session.

Get allegro-4.2.3.1.tar.gz from http://liballeg.org/
    tar xaf allegro-4.2.3.1.tar.gz
    cd allegro-4.2.3.1

"Fix" it for djgpp:
    ./fix.sh djgpp

Apply patches:
    patch -p1 < /path/to/1oom/doc/ext/allegro-4.2.3.1-p1-modern-xmake.patch
    patch -p1 < /path/to/1oom/doc/ext/allegro-4.2.3.1-p2-remove-mouse-cursor.patch
    patch -p1 < /path/to/1oom/doc/ext/allegro-4.2.3.1-p3-disable-unused.patch

Edit xmake.sh and check that the paths and compiler name are correct.
    ./xmake.sh

Copy the header files to the cross compiler:
    cp -r include/* /opt/djgpp/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp/include

Copy the library file to the cross compiler:
    cp lib/djgpp/lib*a /opt/djgpp/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp/lib

Now to cross compile 1oom:
    cd ~/path/to/1oom
    mkdir build-msdos
    cd build-msdos
    ../configure --host=i586-pc-msdosdjgpp && make -j 3


5. Building distributable packages
===================================

Build a tarball requiring no Autotools:
    make dist

Some OS targets support building binary distributions. The bindist scripts
use git for version information if .git/ exists, otherwise the version is
"vUnknown". Files from extrabindist_common/ and extrabindist_$OS/ are copied
to the distribution.

Build a binary distribution:
    make -j 3 && make bindist

Build a binary distribution zip:
    make -j 3 && make bindistzip

This is the "to do" for 1oom.

1. Roadmap
===========

* v0.9:
  - The game is tested and debugged to have no glaringly obvious conversion
    bugs such as crashes. Original MOO1 bugs can remain.
  - A rudimentary cmdline UI exists.

* v1.0:
  - The game is reasonably bug-free. Original MOO1 bugs can remain.
  - OS implementation for at least Unix (Linux) and Windows.
  - HW implementation for at least SDL 1.x.
  - Fully working classic and cmdline UIs.

* v1.1 .. v1.4:
  - Skipped to avoid confusion.

* v2.0:
  - Network multiplayer.
  - Original MOO1 bugs fixed.
  - Alternative AI with less bugs and more difficulty.

2. Random assortment of future features
========================================

* Multiplayer:
  - network: client/server

* Sound:
  - Replace SDL_mixer with a sound/music thread(s) and libfluidsynth, libflac,
    etc. Look at PrBoom+ for code to steal.
  - OPL MIDI backend (+ FAT.AD support).
  - OS MIDI backends.

* UI classic:
  - Add joystick/gamepad support

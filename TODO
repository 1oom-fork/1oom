This is the "to do" for 1oom.

1. Roadmap
===========

* v0.3:
  - Classic UI does everything what MOO1 v1.3 does except copy protection.
  - Modding support via PBX files for all the numerical constants one could
    expect to hexedit in the original EXE.

* v0.8:
  - All "hmm" variables and functions have been given proper names.
  - OS implementations for Unix (Linux) and Windows work.
  - SDL1 HW implementation works.

* v0.9:
  - The game is tested and debugged to have no glaringly obvious conversion
    bugs such as crashes. Original MOO1 bugs can remain.
  - A rudimentary cmdline UI exists.

* v1.0:
  - The game is reasonably bug-free. Original MOO1 bugs can remain.
  - OS implementation for at least Unix (Linux) and Windows.
  - HW implementation for at least SDL 1.x.
  - Fully working classic and cmdline UIs.

* v2.0:
  - Multiplayer.
  - Original MOO1 bugs fixed.
  - Alternative AI with less bugs and more difficulty.

2. Random assortment of future features
========================================

* Multiplayer:
  - local
  - network: client/server

* Sound:
  - Replace SDL_mixer with a sound/music thread(s) and libfluidsynth, libflac,
    etc. Look at PrBoom+ for code to steal.
  - OPL MIDI backend (+ FAT.AD support).
  - OS MIDI backends.

* UI classic:
  - Add UI elements for sound/music volume, full screen, aspect ratio, ...

* HW:
  - Fix SDL2.

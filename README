########

1oom is a clone of the classic DOS game "Master of Orion" (MicroProse, 1993).
1oom is Free Software (GPLv2), see COPYING.

This project is in a very early state and is missing the following:

- testing
- documentation
- polish


1. Installation
================

1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files.

The LBX file can be in a different directory as the executable.
You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-data <path>" when running 1oom.

1.1. Windows
-------------

1oom will only check the directory of the executable.
Simply copy the EXE and DLLs (if any) to your MOO1 directory.

1.2 Linux
----------

1oom requires the following libraries:

- SDL (libsdl1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org
- SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

Also recommended:

- libsamplerate:
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsamplerate/

Check your distribution's package manager or the library
website on how to install them.

The LBX files are first looked for in the directory specified with
"-data <path>".

According to the XDG standard, 1oom will also check the
following directories:

- $XDG_DATA_HOME/1oom
- $XDG_DATA_DIRS/1oom

Or if those variables aren't available:

- ~/.local/share/1oom
- /usr/share/1oom
- .

Choose whichever you prefer.


2. Configuration
=================

1oom is configured via command-line arguments or editing the
configuration file.

2.1. User Directory
--------------------

1oom creates a User directory with all the user savegames and
options in one of the following paths:

- <game directory> (win32)
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/1oom (Linux)
- ~/.config/1oom (Linux)


3. Development
===============

See INSTALL for more information.


4. Executables
===============

1oom consists of a few executables:

- 1oom_classic_sdl1 (the 1993 UI)
- 1oom_cmdline      (proof of concept textual UI)
- 1oom_lbxview_sdl1 (for viewing LBX files)
- 1oom_pbxmake      (for creating PBX files)
- 1oom_gfxconv      (for converting GFX for use in PBX files)
- 1oom_saveconv     (for converting save game files)

See doc/ for more documentation.

4.1. 1oom_classic_sdl1
-----------------------

Middle click or Ctrl-F10 to grab/ungrab input.
Ctrl-Esc to quit (without saving).
Ctrl-Plus/Minus to adjust sfx volume.
Ctrl-Shift-Plus/Minus to adjust music volume.
Alt-Enter to toggle full screen mode.
Otherwise it controls like the original.


5. Acknowledgements
====================

Original game by Simtex Software, published 1993 by MicroProse.
Thanks for the great game and fuckings for not releasing the source code.

Thanks to Something Awful forum user Thotimx for the MOO1 LP which was a
major inspiration in starting this project. Unfortunately the goon writes
parenthesis without the leading space(such as here) like a retard, making the
Le'ts Play [sic] a painful read.

Thanks to
http://www.shikadi.net/wiki/modding/index.php?title=XMI_Format&oldid=6874
for the music format info.

This README is based on the OpenXcom one, except s/folder/directory/g like a
civilized person.

Some code has been pilfered from Chocolate Doom and VICE.

HACKING, PHILOSOPHY and CODE_OF_CONDUCT are based on Chocolate Doom.

5. Acknowledgements
====================

Original game by Simtex Software, published 1993 by MicroProse.
Thanks for the great game and fuckings for not releasing the source code.

Thanks to Something Awful forum user Thotimx for the MOO1 LP which was a
major inspiration in starting this project. Unfortunately the goon writes
parenthesis without the leading space(such as here) like a retard, making the
Le'ts Play [sic] a painful read.

Thanks to

for the music format info.

This README is based on the OpenXcom one, except s/folder/directory/g like a
civilized person.

Some code has been pilfered from Chocolate Doom and VICE.

HACKING, PHILOSOPHY and CODE_OF_CONDUCT are based on Chocolate Doom.

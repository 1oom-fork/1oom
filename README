1oom aims to accurately reproduce the original DOS version of
Master of Orion (1993) in a form that can be run on modern computers.
1oom is Free Software (GPLv2), see COPYING.


1. Installation
================

1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files.

1.1. Windows
-------------

Simply copy the EXE and DLLs (if any) to your MOO1 directory.

1.2 Linux
----------

1oom requires the following libraries:

- SDL (libsdl1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org
- SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

Also recommended:

- libsamplerate:
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsamplerate/

Check your distribution's package manager or the library
website on how to install them.

The LBX files are first looked for in the directory specified with
"-data <path>".

According to the XDG standard, 1oom will also check the
following directories:

- $XDG_DATA_HOME/1oom
- $XDG_DATA_DIRS/1oom

Or if those variables aren't available:

- ~/.local/share/1oom
- /usr/share/1oom
- .

Choose whichever you prefer.


2. Configuration
=================

1oom is configured via command-line arguments or editing the
configuration file.

2.1. User Directory
--------------------

1oom creates a User directory with all the user savegames and
options in one of the following paths:

- <game directory> (win32)
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/1oom (Linux)
- ~/.config/1oom (Linux)


3. Development
===============

See INSTALL and HACKING for more information.


4. Executables
===============

1oom consists of a few executables:

- 1oom_classic_sdl1 (the 1993 UI)
- 1oom_lbxview_sdl1 (for viewing LBX files)
- 1oom_saveconv     (for converting save game files)

See doc/ for more documentation.

4.1. 1oom_classic_sdl1

6. Acknowledgements
====================

Original game by Simtex Software, published 1993 by MicroProse.
Thanks for the great game and fuckings for not releasing the source code.

Thanks to Something Awful forum user Thotimx for the MOO1 LP which was a
major inspiration in starting this project. Unfortunately the goon writes
parenthesis without the leading space(such as here) like a retard, making the
Le'ts Play [sic] a painful read.

Ideas and text snippets have been taken from kyrub's unofficial patch 1.40m
Readme. Thanks for the patch.

Thanks to

for the music format info.

Thanks to CivFanatics forum user sargon0 for partial save game format info in

Thanks to those who contributed code, ideas or bug reports.

This README is based on the OpenXcom one, except s/folder/directory/g like a
civilized person.

Some code has been pilfered from Chocolate Doom and VICE.

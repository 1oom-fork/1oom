1oom is a clone of the classic DOS game "Master of Orion" (MicroProse, 1993).
1oom is Free Software (GPLv2), see COPYING.

This project is in a very early state and is missing the following:

- testing
- polish


1. Installation
================

1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files.
See doc/usage_common.txt for more info.

1.1. Windows
-------------

Simply copy the EXE and DLLs (if any) to your MOO1 directory.

1.2 Linux
----------

1oom requires the following libraries:

- SDL (libsdl1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org
- SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

Also recommended:

- libsamplerate:
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsamplerate/

Check your distribution's package manager or the library
website on how to install them.


2. Configuration
=================

See doc/usage_common.txt.


3. Development
===============

See INSTALL and HACKING for more information.


4. Executables
===============

1oom consists of a few executables:

- 1oom_classic_sdl1 (the 1993 UI)
- 1oom_cmdline      (proof of concept textual UI)
- 1oom_lbxview_sdl1 (for viewing LBX files)
- 1oom_pbxmake      (for creating PBX files)
- 1oom_gfxconv      (for converting GFX for use in PBX files)
- 1oom_saveconv     (for converting save game files)

See doc/usage_* for more documentation.

There are also a few extra executables:

- 1oom_classic_sdl2 (the 1993 UI)
- 1oom_lbxview_sdl2 (for viewing LBX files)

These are experimental and not recommended for use.


5. Acknowledgements
====================

Original game by Simtex Software, published 1993 by MicroProse.
Thanks for the great game and fuckings for not releasing the source code.

Thanks to Something Awful forum user Thotimx for the MOO1 LP which was a
major inspiration in starting this project. Unfortunately the goon writes
parenthesis without the leading space(such as here) like a retard, making the
Le'ts Play [sic] a painful read.

Thanks to

for the music format info.

Thanks to CivFanatics forum user sargon0 for partial save game format info in

This README is based on the OpenXcom one, except s/folder/directory/g like a
civilized person.

Some code has been pilfered from Chocolate Doom and VICE.

HACKING, PHILOSOPHY and CODE_OF_CONDUCT are based on Chocolate Doom.

    --without-readline      do not try to use the readline library
                            (used by 1oom_cmdline)
    --without-samplerate    do not try to use libsamplerate
    --disable-tools         disables extra tools
                            (do not build 1oom_pbxmake, 1oom_gfxconv, ...)
    --disable-uiclassic     disables classic UI
                            (do not build 1oom_classic_*)
    --disable-uicmdline     disables cmdline UI
                            (do not build 1oom_cmdline)
    --disable-sdl1hw        disables SDL1 HW
                            (do not build 1oom_*_sdl1)
    --disable-sdl2hw        disables SDL2 HW
                            (do not build 1oom_*_sdl2)


2. Quick guide
===============

You'll need make and a C99 compiler. You will most likely also want to have
SDL development libraries. Both SDL 1.2.x and SDL2.x are supported.

If you want to use SDL1:
    aptitude install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

If you prefer SDL2:
    aptitude install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev

For better audio quality, also get libsamplerate.
    aptitude install libsamplerate-dev

OpenGL libraries are highly recommended.

If you checked this out with git, do this first:
    autoreconf -fi

Then the usual:
    ./configure && make

!!! You need the data files from the original Master of Orion to run 1oom. !!!

Actual install step is not needed:
    src/1oom_classic_sdl1 -data /path/to/moo
    src/1oom_classic_sdl2 -data /path/to/moo

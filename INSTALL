You'll need make, a C99 compiler and SDL2 development libraries.
    aptitude install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev

For better audio quality, also get libsamplerate.
    aptitude install libsamplerate-dev

OpenGL libraries are highly recommended.

If you checked this out with git, do this first:
    autoreconf -fi

Then the usual:
    ./configure && make

!!! You need the data files from the original Master of Orion to run 1oom. !!!
